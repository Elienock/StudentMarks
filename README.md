# Problem statement


Mr. Mokoena is a lecturer at institution ABC. His students have written a test that is out of 110. He has the marks of all the students. Mr Mokoena needs an 
application that will help him manage the marks of the students. The envisaged application must enable him to do the following:
1. Store the marks of the students in a text file. Store the student number, mark obtained and the final mark, which is the percentage mark. The application 
must ensure that a student number is 5-digit long and that the mark obtained is between 0 and 110, both values inclusive.
2. Read the students data from the text file and display.
3. Get the test data of a specific student.
4. Change the marks of a specific student in the text file.
5. Determine the average test mark.
6. Determine and display the highest mark.
